# AppSprint_POD
It's more than just a social networking app

The design inspiration for the app came from POD as a community. POD is a place where people can share whatever they want to whomever they want.You may wonder how is this different from any other social networking app. The emphasis is on UX .
I want the user to feel comfortable using this app.Using an app shouldn't be rocket science.

The app lets you share stories, posts ,recipies,,videos,tutorials and also games 
KEY FEATURES:
-> A separate community of charity PODs that lets the user directly connect with the members of the POD.He/she can share their thoughts with the community and donate or contribute directly.
->You can share posts in any shape you want but in multiple of grid, by specifying the shape
->BEST OF ALL..You don't have to re-share your posts to meet your aesthetic needs.You can swap the position of a post with a similar shape and sized post!
->Simple UI makes it addictive
Being a complete newbie at this I used Figma in  designing the UI and UX
Starting from the basics, I learnt most of the stuff that the software has to offer in no time
I first drew the layout on a piece of paper before mimicking it on figma
 
At first it seemed hard but I got hold of it later. 
I wish I had more time to prototype it in android studio .I didn't have any time to do that 

I proud that I learnt a new skill.Being a person who's into the creative space , I love this new found skill. Looking forward to going ahead with android development
